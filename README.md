This configuration works on both Linux and WSL envrionnement.  

:warning: If running on WSL  
This config will setup clipboard accrodingly. Make sure [win32yank](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank) is installed and in WSL PATH  

:warning: This configuration does not use Mason
LSP needs to be installed via command line.  
TODO: Make this config detects PPTI (and in the future, restrained environnement) so that Mason can be used to install LSP
